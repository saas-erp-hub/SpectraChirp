# Future Improvements

This document outlines potential future improvements and enhancements for the SpectraChirp MFSK Modem project.



## Frontend Development

**Proposal:** Develop a more interactive and feature-rich web-based frontend for the modem.

**Rationale:** The current `frontend/index.html` provides only basic interaction. A more advanced frontend would significantly improve user experience, allowing for real-time signal visualization, detailed modem configuration, and easier file management.

**Implementation Notes:**
*   Evaluate modern web frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) for development.
*   Implement features such as:
    *   Real-time audio input/output visualization.
    *   Dynamic configuration of modem modes and parameters.
    *   Display of decoding progress and statistics.
    *   Improved file upload/download interface.

## Performance Testing

**Proposal:** Conduct comprehensive performance testing of the modem under various conditions.

**Rationale:** Understanding the modem's performance characteristics (e.g., data rate, latency, CPU usage) across different modem modes and signal-to-noise ratios is crucial for optimizing its efficiency and identifying bottlenecks.

**Implementation Notes:**
*   Develop automated tests to measure data throughput and latency.
*   Simulate different noise levels and fading conditions.
*   Analyze CPU and memory usage during modulation and demodulation.

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Proposal:** Implement end-to-end tests to simulate full user flows and verify the entire system's functionality.

**Rationale:** E2E tests provide a high level of confidence in the system's integration, ensuring that the frontend, backend, and modem logic work seamlessly together.

**Implementation Notes:**
*   Utilize tools like Playwright or Selenium to automate browser interactions.
*   Develop scenarios that cover signal generation, transmission (simulated), reception, and decoding, verifying the final decoded message.

## Digital CB Radio Communication

**Proposal:** Leverage the MFSK modem for robust digital data communication over traditional CB radio channels.

**Rationale:** CB radio channels are known for being noisy and susceptible to various forms of interference (atmospheric, man-made, QRM). The inherent robustness of the MFSK modem, with its Walsh-Hadamard spreading and Reed-Solomon Forward Error Correction (FEC), makes it exceptionally well-suited for reliable data transmission in such challenging High Frequency (HF) environments where voice communication often fails.

**Key Advantages:**
*   **Exceptional Robustness:** MFSK is inherently more robust against fading and noise than single-tone modes. Walsh-Hadamard spreading provides resilience against narrow-band interference and selective fading by distributing information across multiple tones. Reed-Solomon FEC ensures high data integrity, allowing for correct decoding even with significant signal corruption.
*   **Reliable Data Transmission:** Enables the exchange of structured text or other data (e.g., GPS coordinates, sensor readings, short messages) with high integrity, ensuring error-free reception where voice would be unintelligible.
*   **Efficiency and Speed:** While balancing robustness, the modem's various modes (including `ULTRA_FAST`) allow for efficient use of airtime through packetization and synchronization.
*   **Discreteness:** Transmitting data tones is more discreet than voice, offering a degree of privacy.
*   **Automation Potential:** Digital output can be easily integrated with computer applications for automated messaging, logging, telemetry, or simple networking between CB stations.

**Implementation Notes:**
*   **Audio Interface:** Requires connecting the computer's sound card (running the modem software) to the CB radio's microphone input and speaker/headphone output.
*   **PTT Control:** Implement Push-To-Talk (PTT) control for the CB radio, typically via a serial port or VOX.
*   **Bandwidth Compliance:** Ensure MFSK signal bandwidth fits within legal CB channel limits (e.g., 3 kHz for AM/SSB).
*   **Legal Compliance:** Verify local regulations regarding digital data transmission on CB radio.
